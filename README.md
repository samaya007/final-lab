Samaya Kafle;

This is a clash royal game build where i've added a sprint image with six characters along with the game long. I've added a subtle hover effect using css and have added some main images in the sprint. 
I plan to add link in the brand logo when clicked takes to the official game website. I've added some basic colours to make the lightbox popout when hovring and have worked mostlyu with the verdana font and mode the hvoer animation black (image) and white (text).
